    "# Q1. What is Min-Max scaling, and how is it used in data preprocessing? Provide an example to illustrate its application.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Min-Max Scaling**, also known as normalization, is a feature scaling technique that transforms data to a specific range, usually between 0 and 1. It subtracts the minimum value and divides by the range (difference between the maximum and minimum value) for each feature, ensuring that all features are on the same scale.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Formula:\r\n",
    "$$\r\n",
    "X_{\\text{scaled}} = \\frac{X - X_{\\text{min}}}{X_{\\text{max}} - X_{\\text{min}}}\r\n",
    "$$\r\n",

    "### Example:\r\n",
    "Consider a feature with values: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50].\r\n",

    "- Maximum value (\\(X_{\\text{max}}\\)) = 50\r\n",

    "$$\r\n",

    "# Q2. What is the Unit Vector technique in feature scaling, and how does it differ from Min-Max scaling? Provide an example to illustrate its application.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The **Unit Vector** technique, also called normalization to unit norm, scales each data point so that its norm (magnitude) is 1. This is useful in applications where the direction of the feature vector is more important than its magnitude (e.g., text classification or clustering).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Formula:\r\n",
    "$$\r\n",
    "X_{\\text{unit\\_norm}} = \\frac{X}{||X||}\r\n",
    "$$\r\n",

    "### Difference from Min-Max Scaling:\r\n",
    "- **Min-Max scaling** transforms the feature into a specified range (e.g., [0, 1]).\r\n",
    "- **Unit Vector scaling** focuses on making the vector have a unit norm, preserving the direction but not the magnitude.\r\n",

    "### Example:\r\n",
    "For a 2D vector [3, 4]:\r\n",
    "- Norm = \\( \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = 5 \\)\r\n",

    "# Q3. What is PCA (Principal Component Analysis), and how is it used in dimensionality reduction? Provide an example to illustrate its application.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of data while retaining as much variability as possible. PCA transforms the data into a new set of variables (principal components), which are linear combinations of the original features.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### How it works:\r\n",
    "1. Compute the covariance matrix of the data.\r\n",
    "2. Calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.\r\n",
    "3. Select the top \\(k\\) eigenvectors (principal components) based on the largest eigenvalues.\r\n",
    "4. Project the data onto these components, reducing the dimensionality.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Example:\r\n",
    "Consider a dataset with 5 features: \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), \\(D\\), and \\(E\\). If you want to reduce it to 2 dimensions, PCA will select the 2 principal components that capture the most variance in the data and project the data into this 2D space.\r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "PCA is a form of **feature extraction** because it transforms the original features into a new set of features (principal components) that capture the most variance in the data.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### How PCA is used for Feature Extraction:\r\n",
    "PCA identifies the most important directions (principal components) in the data, which are combinations of the original features. By keeping only the top principal components, PCA reduces the number of features while retaining most of the information.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Example:\r\n",
    "Consider a dataset with features [height, weight, age, income, education level]. PCA can reduce these 5 features to 2 principal components. These components are linear combinations of the original features and capture most of the variance.\r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "In a food delivery recommendation system, the features such as **price**, **rating**, and **delivery time** have different ranges. To ensure that no feature dominates the others, we apply **Min-Max scaling**.\r\n",

    "### Steps:\r\n",
    "1. For each feature (price, rating, delivery time), identify the minimum and maximum values.\r\n",
    "2. Apply Min-Max scaling to transform each feature to a common scale (e.g., [0, 1]).\r\n",
