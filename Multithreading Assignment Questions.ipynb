    "Advantages of Multithreading:\n",

    "    effectively. Executing multiple threads concurrently, it can take advantage of parallelism and reduce overall\n",
    "    execution time.\n",
    "   2 Multithreading can enhance responsiveness in applications that involve user interaction. By separating time-consuming\n",
    "    tasks from the main thread, the user interface can remain responsive and not freeze or become unresponsive.\n",
    "   3 Multithreading can enable better resource utilization. For example, in a server application, multiple threads can handle\n",
    "    incoming client requests simultaneously, allowing the server to serve more clients concurrently.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Disadvantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "Multithreading is complex and many times difficult to handle. It has a few drawbacks. These are:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1 If you don’t make use of the locking mechanisms properly, while investigating data access issues there is a chance of\n",
    "    problems arising like data inconsistency and dead-lock.\n",
    "   2 If many threads try to access the same data, then there is a chance that the situation of thread starvation may arise.\n",
    "    Resource contention issues are another problem that can trouble the user.\n",
    "   3 Display issues may occur if threads lack coordination when displaying data."
